        <p>
            My name is Maram Mustafa, 
            I graduated from the University of Jordan with a major in Business Information Technology. 
            I began to expand in the fields of information technology and because it is very large and it is difficult to be familiar with all fields,
             I began to study in the field of networks and got a certificate from the Cisco Academy and unfortunately I did not want to continue in the field of networks,
             and found that I have a passion for programming more than anything Another, 
             and so I started with Luminous College and found it an opportunity to bridge the gap between university theory and the job market
